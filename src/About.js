        <p>Did you know it takes roughly 2 months to learn how to perform Hemodialysis on yourself?</p>
            
        <p>At the age of 23 I suffered kindney failure, going through a whirlwind of treatment, tests, 
        jargon and a whole new way I had to take care of myself. There are some similarities between Dialysis and learning to code.</p>
        
        <p>I started my journey in to coding and web development in 2019, doing simple excersises with my partners dad
        to get a handle on the subject later signing up to study with coder academy in 2020, leaving behind a very glamorous
        career in front-line retail. </p>
 
        <p>steadily growing my skills and combating my own laziness and imposter syndrome are what I'm here for.</p>
